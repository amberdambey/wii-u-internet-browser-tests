# wii-u-internet-browser-tests
These are small projects I made which work on the Wii U Internet Browser. They mostly use motion controls.

This is a test to demonstrate that the Wii U GamePad's accelerometer can be read through the Internet Browser via JavaScript. [More information here](http://wiiubrew.org/wiki/Internet_Browser#Accelerometer)

Controls: Tilt the gamepad to move the marble and draw a trail. Press and hold (A) to change the trail's color. Flick the gamepad up to reset the screen.
