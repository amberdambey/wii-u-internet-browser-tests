These are small projects I made which work on the Wii U Internet Browser. They mostly use motion controls.

This is a test to demonstrate that the Wii U GamePad's accelerometer can be read through the Internet Browser via JavaScript. [More information here](http://wiiubrew.org/wiki/Internet_Browser#Accelerometer)

Controls: Tilt the gamepad to move the marble and draw a trail. Press and hold (A) to change the trail's color. Flick the gamepad up to reset the screen.

----------------
This is a game similar to the popular mobile game [Doodle Jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodle_Jump). You control a small dot by rotating the gamepad and try to touch the platforms to land safely. You can get 10 seconds of a continuous jump by landing on the platforms with a square on them. You lose when you fall off and don't touch any platforms.

Controls: Tilt the gamepad!
